# lib/pip-retry.sh — shared pip retry helpers
#
# pip's own --retries does NOT catch SSL DECRYPTION_FAILED errors on large
# wheel downloads (urllib3 treats them as non-retriable), so these wrap pip
# invocations with a shell-level retry loop. Originally written inline in
# 06-install-ue-analysis.sh; extracted here so every script that does network
# pip installs (04, 06, 09, 10, 11) shares one implementation instead of each
# re-inventing (or omitting) the same resilience.
#
# Usage: source this file, then call `pip_retry install <pkg>` or
# `sudo_pip_retry install <pkg>` exactly like you would call pip3/`sudo pip3`.
# Both are non-fatal after 3 attempts (return 0) so a persistent network
# failure doesn't abort the whole provisioning script under `set -e` — the
# caller should follow up with `record_tool` to make the failure observable.
#
# Both also auto-apply lib/pip-constraints.txt (if present) to every `install`
# call via `-c`, so a version pin declared there holds across every script
# that uses this helper — see that file for what it's for and when to add to
# it. The constraints path is resolved from THIS file's own location, not the
# caller's, so it works regardless of which script sources pip-retry.sh.
